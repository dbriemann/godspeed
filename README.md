# godspeed

A framework for 2d game development, inspired by [love](https://love2d.org/) and [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/).

Currently this readme is just a collection of notes.

## On the shoulders of giants

SDL2 as core.

## Goals

- Easy to start with, easy to use.
- Fast development process, good for prototyping.
- Sane defaults but easy to extend and configure.

## Configurable engine functions

- `godspeed.Init`
- `godspeed.Update(dt float64)`
- `godspeed.Draw()`
- `godspeed.Running() bool`
- `godspeed.Loop()`
